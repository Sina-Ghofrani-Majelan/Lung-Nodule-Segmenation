Thesis tilte:Pulmonary nodule detection Based on Deep Learning
Here is a brief description of my thesis:

Lung cancer is an aggressive disease resulting in more than one million deaths per year worldwide. Sometimes there is a suspicious tissue in the lungs, referred to as a lung nodule. In the early stages, lung cancer generally manifests in the form of pulmonary nodules, and to determine if someone will develop lung cancer, we have to look for the early stages of malignant pulmonary nodules. Pulmonary nodules have different types and forms, and even all of them are not malignant or cancerous. This significant difference in the shape of nodules, as well as their small size, makes nodule detection more difficult. An example of CT images is shown in Figure 1.
